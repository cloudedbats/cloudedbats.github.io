                            CloudedBats is my hobby/spare-time project where I'm trying
                            to develop a complete set of open and free software tools to 
                            be used when acoustically monitoring bats.
                            In the end it should cover the whole path from the ultrasonic
                            microphone to well documented survey results that can be shared.
                        </p>

                            Target groups are both professionals like scientists and
                            environmental consultants as well as citizen scientists and
                            other groups of bat enthusiasts.

                            Why do we need open source software when monitoring bats?

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            For me as a software developer, collaboration and transparency is the only way
                            today to develop and maintain software in an effective way.
                            Everyone is doing it, both beginners as well as big companies like Google
                            and Microsoft.
                            And all software development tools and software libraries I use in the
                            CloudedBats project are open and free. Then it is an easy decision
                            to also let my software to be open and free.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle mb-4">
                            What about the bats?
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            We know too little about the more than 1400 bat species that has been
                            found today, and we must speed up the work. It's urgent because we are
                            living in a rapidly changing world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            Therefore my focus is to find solutions that can be used in all countries,
                            not only in the northern part of Europe where I live. I think it is really
                            important that we also starts to openly and freely shares the sound
                            files that has been recorded directly and don't wait until an article or
                            report has been published. That will make it easier to collaborate if, for
                            example, both scientists and enthusiasts/citizen scientists share their
                            data and sound files.

                                Bats are special because they are so good at hiding.
                                Most bat species are small, they are active when it is dark and
                                they use ultrasound for navigation and communication.
                                Therefore, detectors are needed that can record ultrasound and can be used for
                                either active or passive monitoring.

                                There are good bat detectors available, but I wanted a more flexible and powerful
                                detector that can be extended in functionality when needed. My requirement list was
                                something like this when I started to develop my own detector:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The software should be open and free for all kind of usage, even commercial use
                                    if someone want to include parts of it in products that are sold for money.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hardware should be as cheap as possible and easily available where they are selling
                                    electronic things. The core part should be a small computer that can run the
                                    operating
                                    system Linux.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There must be support for high quality ultrasonic microphones for professional use,
                                    but also a possibility to have entry level alternatives for beginners.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                                This resulted in a Do-It-Yourself, DIY, bat detector based on three main parts:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Computer:</span>
                                    Raspberry Pi is a small computer that is powerful enough and has a
                                    lot of features that makes it good to use for a bat detector.
                                    The base price for it is 35$, but it will cost somewhere between 50 and 100$
                                    depending on taxes and model.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Microphone:</span>
                                    Ultrasonic microphones with USB connections are supported.
                                    The detector automatically identifies microphones from Pettersson and Dodotronic.
                                    For entry level options there are sound cards available that runs at a sampling
                                    rate of 192 kHz.
                                    That will be enough for the most common bat species and sound up to about 90 kHz
                                    can be recorded.
                                    But then you have to find a suitable microphone element and build that part
                                    yourself.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Software:</span>
                                    This is the part that I develop myself. Mainly based on my own needs and
                                    what I think is fun to develop.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                                The rest is probably things you already have. Power supply for the
                                Raspberry Pi computer is the same as the USB power sources used for mobile
                                phones.
                                The user interface for the detector is a web page that can run in a web
                                browser in your computer or mobile phone.
                                Recorded files can be stored on USB memorry sticks, or internally in the
                                detector for later download to a computer.
                                Then there are extra options like
                                USB GPS receivers for time and position and
                                USB 4G modems for internet access.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two things that makes other bat detector alternatives better.
                                One is power consumption and the Raspberry Pi needs up to 5 Watt of power
                                where other detectors can run for weeks on standard batteries.
                                A slightly bigger Powerbank can be used for single night sessions and will
                                last for about 12 hours.
                                If power is available you can use a mobile phone charger and run it permanently.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other problem is that you must know a little about computers and how to run
                                commands from a terminal window when installing the software.
                                If you don't have that knowledge you must ask for help, but I think that there
                                are many people who will be happy and found it interesting to set up a
                                Raspberry Pi for bat monitoring if you ask them.

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    One WURB detector is for active monitoring. Audio feedback is activated and I
                                    use a technique called pitch shifting for that.
                                    It is like frequency division but the sound quality is not destroyed,
                                    the frequencies are just divided by a factor between 10 and 50.
                                    Recordings can be triggered either manually or automatically when sound is
                                    detected.
                                    If a GPS receiver is attached each file will have the correct position in the
                                    file name that makes is useful for transect monitoring.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Then I have two detectors with powerbanks for deployment over night.
                                    The GPS receiver can be removed after deployment since the position will
                                    not change. If they are within a WiFi network they can be controlled
                                    remotely and recorded files can be download while they are running and
                                    are recording new files. I also have two 4G modems that can be used to set up
                                    communication tunnels (similar to VPN) for remote access and file download
                                    from anywhere where internet is available. This is really handy because the
                                    detectors can then be controlled and checked that they was correctly setup,
                                    and you don't have to wait to the day after to start analyzing the recorded
                                    files.
                                </li>

                                    The last one is a permanent station at home where the WURB detector is
                                    connected and powered by using Power-over-Ethernet, PoE. It is then open
                                    to the internet and anyone can log in as a read-only user and download
                                    files by using SFTP. It was deployed in may 2021 and except for some problems
                                    with thunderstorms it has been running for about 7 months at the moment
                                    (and there are bat activities even when there is snow and the temperature
                                    is below zero degC).

                                bat detector and can be setup to run over longer time periods and the price
                                tag is low.

                            Post processing is about everything that happens when the sound files
                            are recorded. The most common situation seems to be something like this;
                            detectors are deployed over night and collected the day after, then some
                            SD cards, or similar, are moved to a desktop computer where the analysis is
                            done by using some kind of software installed on that computer.
                            In many cases the files are collected during the so called "bat season"
                            and the analysis is done after the season. Then the results are documented
                            just before the preparation for the next "bat season" begins.

                            There are many things that can be handled in a more efficient way.
                            For me as an amateur there is no specific "bat season". Bats are
                            active also during winter and the most interesting things happens
                            outside the traditional "bat season",
                            during migrations, mating periods, etc.
                            If we can't get an automatically generated activity report from last
                            nights deployed detectors ready before the morning coffee
                            then we are probably loosing a lot of people that are not payed for
                            working with bats.
